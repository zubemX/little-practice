            <h1> 2023: We remain PDP, fighting for inclusivity, Wike tells allies</h1>
            <P>GOVERNOR Nyesom Wike of Rivers state says he has no reason to leave the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), no matter the situations threatening the unity of the party ahead of the 2023 general elections.

                    Wike at a Rivers PDP stakeholders meeting in Port Harcourt Thursday, the first of such since the rancorous presidential primaries and picking of running mate, also said to, on Friday, keep his promise to tell his own side of the story over the contentions since after. The governor said that he was interested in preserving the sanity of the party and will stay back to fight for the enthronement of unity, inclusivity, equity and peace in the PDP.

                    Priding themself as men of character who keep their word, Wike declared, “I have always told people, if anybody is thinking we will leave PDP, foul. We will fight at the party. We are not like them when in 2014 they walked out of Eagle Square. They’ve forgotten. They walked out and joined APC. Is it not correct? “Did they remain to fight inside the party? But we remained, they ran away. Now, there is a fight at the party, we will not run. We will fight it at this party. Those who run away from the fight are weak people. We will not. So everybody should know this is the state where we are. So that nobody tells you all kinds of stories.”

                    The governor the party constitution clearly stating that elective and party offices must be zoned and should be respected, wondering why the former PDP Board of Trustee (BOT) Chairman would be pressured to resign and while national chairman, Sen Iyorchia Ayu excuses himself from doing what is right. </P>
